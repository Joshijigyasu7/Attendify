Attendify is an AI-powered attendance system that automates student attendance marking using face recognition and uniform detection. The system utilizes OpenCV for real-time video processing, face recognition for identifying students, and NumPy for mathematical operations. It features Tkinter for an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) and uses pandas to store attendance records in a CSV file. Additionally, yagmail is integrated for automated email reporting, while pyttsx3 provides text-to-speech announcements for real-time feedback. To enhance performance, the project employs threading to prevent the GUI from freezing.

The folder structure includes a students folder to store student face images. The system generates an attendance.csv file that records marked attendance. To set up the project, users need to clone the repository, install dependencies from the requirements.txt file, add student images, and run python main.py. The system can detect multiple students at once and ensures accurate attendance marking with voice alerts.
